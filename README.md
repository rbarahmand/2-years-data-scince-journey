# Main Content

## Statistics, Probability and, Linear Algebra

* [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential-dp-149207294X/dp/149207294X/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) - Good introductory book on statistics by Bruce brothers owner of [statistics.com](https://www.statistics.com/), the main advantage of this book is summarizing key concepts and using best python and R libraries to create awesome visualizations and implementing statistical methods. I have also presented this book [check it here.]()

## Data Preparation and Feature Engineering

* [Feature Engineering for Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Feature-Engineering-Machine-Learning-Principles/dp/1491953241) - A great in depth book on specific topic of feature engineering by Amazon and Google super data scientist [Alice Zheng](https://alicezheng.org/) and [Amanda Casari.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amcasari/)
