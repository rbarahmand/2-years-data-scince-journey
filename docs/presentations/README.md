# My Presentations on books, subjects and, etc

This repository was created for sharing my presentations about **Data Science** on books.

## Description

As anyone knows the best way to learn a subject is to teach them so I decided to share what I read and what I learned in order to make it stick in my mind and of course to add a value to this active community of beginner learners.

Stay tuned for my other series of presentations! üòç.
